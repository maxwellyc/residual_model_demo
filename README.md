Modeling Nuclear Separation Energies using Neural Networks.
This is a demo for the idea behind publications (without the Bayesian part, since MCMC process takes weeks):
• Bayesian approach to model-based extrapolation of nuclear observables, Phys. Rev. C. 98, 034318 (2018)
• Neutron drip line in the Ca region from Bayesian machine learning, Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 062502 (2019)
• Beyond the proton drip line: Bayesian analysis of proton-emitting nuclei, Phys. Rev. C 101, 014319 (2020) 
• Quantified limits of the nuclear landscape, Phys. Rev. C 101, 044307 (2020)
